# Updated Portfolio

## In this homework assignment I was prompted with the task of updating my professional coding portfolio grab the attention of employers who are seeking me for employment. This was a different type of task. I was able to put my own touch on my code more than usual. I believe this site is appealing and extremely easy to use. I am proud of the 4 projects I have displayed. They may not be the most appealng, but at least they are an example of the progress being made during the course of this class.
